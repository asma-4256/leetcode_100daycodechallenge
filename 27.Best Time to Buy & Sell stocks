121.Best Time to Buy & Sell stocks

Time complexity:O(n)
Space complexity:O(1)

code(c++):
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int maxProfit=0, buy=prices[0];
        for(int i=1;i<prices.size();i++){
            if(prices[i]>buy){
                maxProfit=max(maxProfit,prices[i]-buy);
            }
            buy=min(buy,prices[i]);
            
        }
        return maxProfit;
        
    }
};

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

Very easy problem take every day as a selling day & take minimum of before elements as a buy and take the profit for every price and return the maxProfit at end.........
