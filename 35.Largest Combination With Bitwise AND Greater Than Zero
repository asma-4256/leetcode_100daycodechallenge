2275. Largest Combination With Bitwise AND Greater Than Zero

           Time complexity:O(n)
           Space complexity:O(1)

  code(c++):
  class Solution {
public:
    int largestCombination(vector<int>& candidates) {
        int maxcount=0;
        for(int i=0;i<24;i++){
            int count=0; 
            for(int num:candidates){
                if(((num & (1<<i)))!=0){
                    count++;
                }
            }
            maxcount=max(maxcount,count);
        }
        
        
        return maxcount;
        
    }
};


Example 1:

Input: candidates = [16,17,71,62,12,24,14]
Output: 4
Explanation: The combination [16,17,62,24] has a bitwise AND of 16 & 17 & 62 & 24 = 16 > 0.
The size of the combination is 4.
It can be shown that no combination with a size greater than 4 has a bitwise AND greater than 0.
Note that more than one combination may have the largest size.
For example, the combination [62,12,24,14] has a bitwise AND of 62 & 12 & 24 & 14 = 8 > 0.



Firstly taken an count & until the 24 bits times of length of each value in candidates are performed AND operation & the value s greater than zero that means value equal to zero increase the count 
         calculaate count for all the 24 bits length positions and gives the maximum one as output....
